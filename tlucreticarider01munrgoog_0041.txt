1001011 codices. From whom come the many excellent emendations 001-
tained in these mss is quite unknown. Lachmann used a not very
complete collation of Flor. 31, 0111 10 11 he attributes the corrections
which it has for the most part in common with the Cambridge and
doubtless some other mss. Having been told 100 by H. Keil 11011 whom
he got the collation that it was written by Antonius Marii filius, he fills
his commentary from one end 10 the other with tho name 01 this worthy
Florentine notary. Ι 001 only say that I compared it with ten or more
voluminous mss. written in magnificent style and signed by this man be-
tween 1420 end 1451 011 closely resembling each other, and neither in
general appearance nor in the form ef particular letters nor in their
abbreviations have they any resemblance 10 the ms. of Lucretius. This
scribe's name thereforeI have excluded from my notes. Of the other
Laurentian mss. 29 is to be noticed 1011110 marginal annotations of

As further helps I have had Gitanius’ ed. 01 1595 with ms. 110100 by
Nic. Heinsius which I bought from H. G. Bohn many years ago: it will
be seen that I 11010 derived from it some valuahle emendations notin
