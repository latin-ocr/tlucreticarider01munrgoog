l to 11 422 and other passages, The inference then I draw from all this
is that both Avancius and Marullus did much for Lucretius, Marullus
doubtless more than Avancius 3 that much which is peculiar to the
J untine is not from Marullus, and much of what Marullus did is
not in the J untine. Between them they vastly improved a grievously
corrupt text3 and though they introduced many perversities, we ought
in simple justice to take into consideration only what is good. In my
notes for obvious reasons, when Ald. l and J unt. agree in a reading, I
mention both; when a reading is peculiar to Ald. 1, I assign it to
Avancius by name3 when it first appears in J unt, I still say J unt,
though it is always to be inferred that the best readings are most
likely due to Marullus. By assigning to him all alike one would often
be doing him less, sometimes more than justice.

[In my second edition however Iwas able to throw fresh light on the
history and criticism of Lucretius' text by the undoubted corrections of
Pontanus and Marullus, still existing among the books and manuscripts
of Peter Victorius which have formed for centuries so valuable a portion
of the Munich library. They were examined by me and copied out in
the summer of 1865, my attention having been directed to them by a
Goettingen program of Prof. Sauppe. The learned writer informs us
that he had examined the Munich ms. of Lucretius and found it cor-
rected throughout by some Italian scholar. Where (laudidus the editor
of the J untine mentions in his note a reading of MaruHus, this reading
invariably appeared among these corrections. From this and other indi-
cations he concluded, and the conclusion seemed most reasonable, that
these were the very corrections of Marullus which Candidus had used for
his edition. He makes the probable suggestion that the long connexion
ol Victorius with the Giuntas would readily explain his possessiones a
manuscript which had belonged to th'at firm.

At Munich through the courtesy of the librarian Ihad the full use oi
the following important documenta: l. the manuscript just mentioned:
2. a copy of the Venice edition of 1495 with corrections by Pontanus in
the handwriting of Victorius who describes them in the first page as
‘emendationes ex Pontani codice testantis ipsum ingenio eas expromp
sisse’: 3. another copy of the same edition likewise corrected through-
out by the hand of Victorius who says at the end ‘contuli cum duobus
codicibus, altero Ioviani Pontani, altero vero Marulli poetae Bizantii,
impressis quidem, sed ab ipsis non incuriose, ut patet, emendatis, quos
commodum accepi ab Andrea Cambone patritio Florentino u.n.xx.
Idibus Martiis. Petrus Victorius’. What the printed edition was from
which he copied these emendations of Marullus I do not know: very
likely it was this Venice edition itself which must have had a large
circulation and was the very edition containing Marullus' notes which
