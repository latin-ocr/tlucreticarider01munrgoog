Heinsius may have here been misled by Modius' negligence. It would

seem certainly that s and B arethe same: 11 they are two, then their

agreement is very extraordinary, much closer than that between B and
the Gottorpian fragment.

I also possess a copy 01 Faber’s Lucretius with apocr collation 01 A
and B and the Gottorp. as well as many other notes and illustrations in
the writing 01 Ιο000 Vossius. Havercamp had a copy 01 the same notes,
but has employed them with his usual carelessness. N otes 1 will show
what important use Ι have made 01 them ε they have enabled me 10 strip
him 01 seyeral 01 110 most showy feathers with which he had decked
himself either from negligence or worse. Spengel, Christ, Goebel and
some others have in various journals and publicatione made much ado
about a codex Victorianus as they 001111, once belonging 10 P. Victorius,
now in the Munich library, as 11 11 were a rival, or nearly so, 01 Α and
B. From the readings cited I see clearly that it is a common Italian
fiftecnth century ms. neither better nor worse than twenty others, much
resembling the Verona and Venice editions and 01 no importanoe what·
ever. [As the reader has been already told, I examined this manuscript
myself 01 Munich during the summer of 1865 aad can confidently affirm
that what I said 01 itis 110 truth. It is much interpolated: its correc-
tions are not so valuable as those 01 Flor. 31 or I think 01 our Cambridge
manuscript. Ihave recorded some 01 110 readings in my critical notes
under the term ‘Mon.', and have occasionally spoken 01 11 00 110 codex
Victorii. Strange that learned men should have taken 00 much trouble
about its own readings and said not a word 01 110 much more important
emendations 01 Marullus which it contains This is not the case with
Prcf. Sauppe in the program spoken 01 above; but I cannot help citing
from its first page a few lines which I read with no slight surprise:
‘unum add0, quod ab aliis nondum quod sciam animadversum coniectu-
ram de victoriani codicis origine propositam valde confirmet. Post l. 3
enim v. 360 versus novem scripti sunt, quos delendos esse homo quidam
doctissimus in margine monuit, qui versus 403-411 per errorem hic il-
latos esse vidisset. ratione eutem subducta inter v. 360 et 403 versus bis

archetypo vero oblongi C. Lachmannus ostendit p. 3. 49. 233. aliis locis
eandem versuum rationem fuisse '. Probably before this time the learned
writer will have discovered that his arithmetic is at fault and that he
has counted forty-two as fifty-two 3 and that his theory is thus entirely
upset. But it 10 not for such a trifle as that, that I have quoted his
words. Does he really mean to assert that this Munich is not like every
other fifteenth century ms. 0 descendant 01 theone brought into Italy by
Poggiol that the long lost archetype was preserved by some mysterious
