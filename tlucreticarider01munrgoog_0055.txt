Bentl. need no explanation after what has been said3 and in this
edition Pont and liar. designate Pontanus and Marullus, whose read·
ings Ι have got hom the sources mentioned. The dots... imply that
one verse, ⁴ that more than one or an uncertain number are lost3
i such interpolatione as it has been deemed advieable bo retain iu
⁸ the text, are printed in small mpitals3 the letters syllables and words
Κ which are omitted in the mss but can be restored with more or less
certainty, are giren in Italics In quoting Ennius the last edition,
that of Vahlen, has been nsed3 for the fragments of the Roman scenio
writers, except Ennius, that of Ribbeck: iu citing Cicero the smaller
sections are referred to as far the most convenient for reference: ior
Terence the several recent editious; ior Plautus Ritschl and Fleckeisen
in the plays they hare publisbed ; in the others the old variorum ed.
has been employed ε in Pliny the sections oi recent editions are cited, as
the older divisions are intolerably awkward. Notes l have becn made
as short as is consistent with perspicnity: nnleae the contrary is
expressly stated or implied, the word or words which appear first in
the note are those of our text3 thus ‘genitabilis qmaalo eta' significa
that ymaahilra is the right reading and is found in A and B and the
other chief authorities, but pendatis is mentioned for the reasons given.
Again ι281 picam Lach ior quem. quod Junt’ means that Iachmann
first gave the correct reading quam instead of qzoem which is the read-
ing ot' A and B and other mss as well as editions before the J untine
of 1512 which prints qaod, the reading generally followed by the old
editors. Oi course if any one before Lachmann had read mmm, he,
not lachmann, would have beeu cited for it ‘Ed' means the present
editor. Iet it always be remembered that the corrupt reading, cited
in a note, is that which appears in A and B, unless the contrary is
expressly stated.

The passages which were first added to the second edition have
been enclosed within [ ] in cases where ambignity or awkwardness
might be occasioned, if no distinction were made between the old and
the new matter; but not otherwise.
