10 INTRODUC'IION

the other hand, that Candidus took from Avancius without acknowledg-
ment much that Lachmann and others asaign to Marullus Candidus,
as I have said above, formed his text on a copy of the first Aldine: in
doing this he must have had before him another edition with the ms.
notes of Marullus, perhaps the very one which he tells us was found on
him at his death. lf now all that is common to the first Aldine and the
J untine comes from Marullus, as Lachmann maintains, surely Candidus
must have been struck with this coincidence and would have recorded
it against Avancius the editor of the great riva-l publisher. Yet Avan-
cius did borrow largely, very largely from Marullus, especially in the case
of interpolated verses made by the latter. How is this to be explainedl
Evidently even before his death Marullus' labours on Lucretius were
known3 and probably there were more copies than one of these, the one
not always agreeing with the other. On this point compare notes l to
1 551-627, where Candidus makes some perverse transpositions oi
verses, on the authority of Marullus he says in his note at the end, but
the learned annotator of one of the laurentian mss. states that some put
tol-564 after 576, and adds ‘verum Marullo parum referre videtur quo
modo legatur’. This annotator and Avancius Pius Candidus Gitanius
can hardly all have had the same copyt perhaps all were different. Avan-
cius then may have had his notes in the very copy of Ven. on which he
formed his text, and may have looked on them as public property which
he might make use of without acknowledgment according to the prac-
tice of the time3 for neither Pius nor Candidus acknowledges in his
turn what he got from Avancius3 nor does Naugerius the editor os
Ald. 2 say a syllable oi Candidus whose edition he copied with few
variations. ¹

But Lachmann to 111 98 cites in proof of his charge that Avancius ’
was a dishonest plagiary three interpolated verses which doubtless were
composed by Marullus and are corruptly given in Ald l. In notes
l to 111 98 I have attempted to shew from Gifanius that Marullus
perhaps wrote putarit, and that Avancius intended to read the same:
Avancius was probably as good a Latin scholar as Marullus, if less
versed in Lucretius. In the line inserted after 1v102 multoc for multae
may be an error of the printer or an oversight of Avancius. In that
inserted after 1v 532 there can be little doubt that he purposely wrote
cuis, imagining that oria was a plural. The correcting of texts was then
in its infancy, and Avancius had so grievous a task before him in making
sense out of the monstrously corrupted Venice edition, that much must
in fairness be excused: we cannot tell what were the exact relations

between him and Aldus and his printera At the end oi his Catullus
published two years later he has taken occasion to give four pagos

of Lucretian criticism, in which he has proposed many excellent altera·
tions of his former text, though I do not find that any editor before me
