20 INTRODUOTION

the last 01 1110 1200 quarto pages there is not a single explanation 01 the
words or philosophy 01 his author for which a schoolboy would thank
him: so incurably inaccurate and illogical was his mind. Yet owing to
tha boldness with which 110000011οᾶ his protensione 110 was thought even
by scholars to have done something great 101 his author: he received
complimentary letters from Heyne and Jacobs, ‘hominibus modestis
01 ab omni iudicii subtilitate abhorrentibus, and more 111011 thirty years
afterwards Forbiger in preparing 1110 compilation 101 the use 01 the
general public took him for his supreme authority. Even later than that
00 31001 0 scholar 00 Ph. Wagner often appeals 10 him in his notes
to Virgil. But though long in coming the 01011301 was 10 be.

Already in 1832 Madvig in a short academical program, afterwards
republished among his opuscula, exposed the futility of Wakefield‘s
criticism and gave some intimatione 01 the right course 10 pursue. Sti-
mulated by his example more than one scholar followed up the attack.
The most important contribution 01 this kind was made by Jacob
Bernays in an article printed in the Rhenish Museum of 1847. This
able paper would have produced 0 greater effect than it did, if it had
not been 00 soon superseded by Lachmann's more complete and systema
tical work This illustrious scholar great in so many departments of
philology, sacred, classical and Teutonic, seems 10 have looked upon
Latin poetry 00 his peculiar province. Lucretius his greatest work was
the main occupatiori of the last five years of his life, from the autumn 01
1845 10 November 1850. F ortunately he had the full use 101 many
months of the two Leyden mss. His native sagacity, guided and 0110111-
ened by long and varied experience, saw at a glauce their relations 10
each other and to the original from which they were derived, and made
clear the arbitrary way in which 1110 common texts had been constructed.
. His zeal warming 00 he advanced, one truth after another revealed itself ¹
10 him, so that at length 110 obtained by successive steps a clear insight
into the condition in which the poem left the hands 01 110 author iu the
most essential points. Like many other great scholare he 0001110 10 have
kept few 01110 common-place books. Resolved to master 1110 subject he
peruscd the grammarians and poets and nearly the whole of 1110 older
writers in order 10 illustrate Lucretius through them and them by
Lucretius, and the Latin language by all. He had an almost unequalled
power 01 3100111113 0 subject in its widest extent and filling up 1110
minutest details. One mark of a great original critic, which eminently
belongs 10 Lachmann, is this: 01011 when wrong, he puts into your
hands the best weapons for refuting himself, and by going astray makes
the right path 000101101 others 10111111. Another test is this, when his
influence extends far beyond his immediate author. Now hardly any
work of merit has appeared in Germany since Lachmann’s Lucretius in
any branch of Latin literature without bearing on 0101111030 the impress
