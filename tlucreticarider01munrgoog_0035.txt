edition in two large volumes. Though his reputation has never been
great, my readers will hardly perhaps he prepared for what Ι am going

to say. As Professor in Leyden he had the full use of the two Vossian
mss there, the main foundation 01 0 genuine text: how did he nse this
advantage, which in profession he makes so much 011 The chief feature
of his edition is a vast and cumbrous apparatus 01 various readings,-
derived from about thirty-one sources professedly distinct. Of these
thirty-one twenty-two are simply the various readings 01 1100 London
edition just mentioned which Havercamp has taken and tumbled into
his own without changing the notation. Most of these are of the most
futile nature, taken from worthless editions which reprint 00 ignorantly
depart from those of Giunta, Aldus, Lambinus 00 Gifanius, such as that
of Pareae, Gryphius, Fayus, Nardius and the French translator the
Baron de Contures: the more worthless the authority, the more fully it
seems to be given There are also some collations of the mss. 01 Vossius
and that in the Bodleian which it did the London bookseller credit to
get together. The nine remaining authorities are these: a certain Basil
edition 01 1531, its marginal readings a collation 01 the Verona edition
of 1486, 0100 jottings in its margin from three unknown mss, a second
collation 01 the Bodleian, and lastly the two all-important Leyden mss,
The two last are the only authorities he has collated himself. How has
he performed this taskl he has not noted one reading in three; the most
important variations he usually emita, and the readings he gives are as
often wrong as right. That which he has horrowed from others and
thrown in a lump into his edition is for the most part as worthless as
the scrihhlings of a schoolboy. So incredibly careless is he, that the
Vossian collations which he borrows from Tonson are 00 should be those
01 his Leyden mss: see note 1 10 v 401 100 0 glaring instance 01 010100
reading which he slavishly copies from Tonson and ascribes to his
Leyden quarto. Nay more the Bm 01 the London edition and his own
X 000 one and the same Bodleian ms. so that we have this ludi-
000000 result, that the same ms. is cited twice over as two independent
authorities. His various readings are therefore not only cumbrously
inane, but are a snare and delusion, and have led astray those who like -
Wakefield have trusted to them. Thus in his hands the two unrival-
led Leyden mss. have been worse than useless. What he does him-
self is always worse done than what he borrows from others, poor as
that generally is: he has collated ncne 01 theold editions except the
Verona, and that was done 100 him, and better done than he would have
done it 100 himself. Nor are his explanatory notes much better: he has
heaped together in a crude mass those of the chief editors, but except in
the case of Virgil and Horace and one 00 two others 01 the best known
poets, indexes to which are in everybody’s hands, he has not even sup·
plied the references to Lambinus' learned notes who from the circum-
