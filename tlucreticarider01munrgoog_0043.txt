intervention t'or the special uae 61 the copyist 61 this codexl Agmn I
would ask whether he looks upon the laboriosa and sagacious calcula-
tione, by which Lachmann demonstrated the number of peges in the lost
archetype and the number 61 verses in each page, as a mere plaything
thus to be trilled with; and not rather as a key to unloclr many secreta
of criticism and not to be understood even without some slight effert oi'
mind I beg to tell him that the number of lines in the archetype he«
tween 111 360 6116 4031166 not either 52 or 42, but 44 ; that is to say
42 verses 61 the poemetwo hesdinge: and that 111 360 616 1161 com-
mence, nor 111 402 terminate a lesi ; but that 111 360 was the fifth line
61 page 108 61 the archetype, and 111 loa was the fourth line lrom the
bottom of page109. Further study too will perhaps make him regret.
that he has put the unfortunate paragraphs between 1 503 and 634 16 a
fresh tortore, and permit him to see that in no part of the poem is the
argument or text in a 661111661- state—But even while revising the 2nd
ed for the prosa I found in a recent program by Th Bergk, with the
name of Ed. Heine on the title-page, a fresh attempt to meguiiy this

so delinita an assertion should be printed, when in truth this manuscript
has the verses in just the same inverted order, in which they are given
hythe Leyden and all other known mssl Nay more the corrector
(Marullus without doubt) arranges the disordered lines, whether aiter
Politian or not, exactly as Candidus does in the J untine, who beyond
any question adopted his arrangement from this manuscript And yet
the main purpose of the program spoken 61 16 16 prove Marullus not to
116 the corrector 61 this Victorian codex, and to prove it 116111 this very
passage t] It will be seen that by the materiale which I have collected
and just described I have in many important cases got nearer than has
been done before 16 the readings 61 Poggio's ms. which was a worthy

But Lachmann's long experience and disciplined acuteness have en-
abled him to go beyond existing mss. and to tell us much 61 the lost
archetype, as I call it efter him, 61 611 existing mss. Notes 1 will show
that many difficulties are cleared up by this knowledge. This archetype
then, though itis not certain that even A was immediately taken 116111

were 1161 separated, but in the middle of verses points were put at the
end 61 clauses. Ancient mss. as a rule keep with singular care to the
