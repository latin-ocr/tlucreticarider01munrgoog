corpora prima quod in summis fluitare videmus

rebus et interdum nasci subitoque perire.

quin etiam refert nostris in versibus ipsis

cum quibus et quali sint ordine quaeque locata.

si non omnia sunt, at multo maxima pars est 1017
consimilis; verum positura discrepitant res.

sic ipsis in rebus item iam materiai

concursus motus ordo positura figurae
cum permutantur, mutari res quoque debent.
Nunc animum nobis adhibe veram ad rationem.
nam tibi vementer nova res molitur ad auris
accedere et nova se species ostendere rerum. ¹1025
sed neque tam facilis res ulla est quin ea primum
difficilis magis ad credendum constet, itemque
Ἴ nil adeo magnum neque tam mirabile quicquam,
quod non paulatim minuant mirarier omnes.

here they interrupt the sense: 1020 the interpolator has transferred hither without
