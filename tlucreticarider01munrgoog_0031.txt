and unfounded lachmann’s procedure is in assigning everything that is
new in the Juntine to Marullus: even in the many instances where he
and I are in agreement, it must be remembered that 110 speaks without
authority, while I possess the testimony 01 Marullus himself]

The J untine oloses the first great epoch 01 improvement in the text
01 Lucretius: the second Aldine edited hythe well-known scholar An-
drew Naugerius and dated ‘mense ianuario u.n.xv.' is for the most part
a 111010 reprint 01 11 without however one word 01 aeknowledgmcnt ao·
cording to the usage of 1110 time. Yet the changes are not few, mostly
for the better, not always: two instaures are given above from the first
page, the one a gross corruption, the other a right rejection 01 011 inter·
polation. For the next fifty years Ald. happears to have been the model ⁸
edition Gryphius 01 Lyons published several texts, three 01 which
I have before me: they generally follow Naugerius, but not always,
often recurring 10 Avancius. Those 01 1534 and 1540 have many mar-
ginal readings, most of them taken 110111 Avancius 011110 notes of Pius,
a few from sources not known 1ο me: see notes l 101 977 efficiatque.
Yet even these two editions do not always agree with each other.

Little advance however was made on the J untinc before Dionysius
Lambinus. He dates his address to Oharles IX 1 November 1563 and
afterwards speaks 01 his first edition as published in that year ; though
the title-page 01 my copy has 1564. Lambinus was among the most il-
lustrious 01 1110 great Latin scholare who studied and taught 01 Ρο110 in
the sixteenth century. His knowledge 01 Cicero and the older Latin
writers as well 00 the Augustan poets has never been surpassed and
rarely equalled. Whoever doubts that the nicest critical and gramma·
tical questions can be expressed in 0100101101 Latin without effert or
affectation, let him study the commentaries 01 Lambinus. Scaliger says
of him ‘Latine et Romane loquebatur optimeque scribebat’: his esse
aud readiness are astonishing. He made use he tells us of five mss:

four 01 these appear to have been Italian mss 01 the fifteenth century:
the fifth, 01 which he used a collation by Turnebus, and which he calls
the Bertinian, was the same as the Leyden quarto. In his praiaco and
throughout the work he acknowledges his obligations 10 Turnebus and

Auratus. His Lucretius is perhaps the greatest 01 his works: there was
more to be done 11010, and therefore he has done more. He had more-
over a peculiar admiration ior this author, 01 whom in the preface 10 his
third edition he says ‘omnium poetarum Latinorum qui hodie exstant 01
qui ad nostram aetatem pervenerunt elegantissimus et purissimus, idem-
que gravissimus atque ornatissimus Lucretius est’. If his boast that he
has restored the text in 800 places goes beyond the truth‚ though I am
not sure that it does, yet the superiority 01 his over all preceding texts
can scarcely be exaggerated 3 for the quickness 01 his 1111011001 united
with his exquisite knowledge 01 the language gave him great power in
