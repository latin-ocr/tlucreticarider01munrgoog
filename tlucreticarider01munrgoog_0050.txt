In following Lachmann then I am sure that Ι have authority on my
side 3 I believe that I have reason as well. In those 01111 indeed ιο
which I have already referred, where the universal testimony 01 inscrip-
tions and 01 mss beyond a certain age proves that thereis only one right
way and about which the best scholare are all now agreed, there cannot
be any doubt what course should be taken: we must write querella
loquella 111111 sollcrs 1011111111 sollicito Iuppiter littera quattuor stuppa
lamminc3 on the other hand milia 0011010 0011111 coniti 0011111 0011110
conubium belua baca 11011 litua and the like3 condicio 1011011111, actius
11111 (adj.) autumnae suboles: in many of thern an important principle
isinvolved: obeying the almost unanimous testimony 01 our own and
other good mss we cannot but give 1111111 1110111111 the like: also
fiiempa. Ι have heard it asked what then is the genitive 01 biceps: ιο
which the best reply perhaps would be what is the perfect 01 1111001
supine 01 cmo. The Latius wrote hiemps, as they wrote emptum sampsi
sumptam and a hundred such forms, because they disliked m and 1 01 ι
to come together without the intervention 01 ap sound 3 and our mss all
attest this: tempto likewise is the only true form, which the Italians in
the 15111 century rejected sor tento. Then mss. and inscriptions prove
that d took an 1 before it, 11111011 quendam cundem and the like, with
the exception 01 circumdo in which thamsa. both 01 Lucr. and Virgil
always retain the m: and generally, though not invariably, m on the
other hand remained before q: quemquern tamquam and so on; though
the new corpus inscrip. Lat. has I find nunquam 5 and so 1111 Augustus
in his res gestae, but quotiescumque. Then always quicqua 1110011111
quicquid (111111), but generally quidquid (relative), though quicquid is
found in 1111 lex Rubria and once in our AB: always peremo inteream>
neqkqo intellego etc. Above all we must scout such barbarisms 11 coelum
11011111 sylva caetera nequicquam. In these points Wagner is 11 good a
guide as Lachmann3 but in regard ιο the 01111 11 which ancient usage
varied shall we follow the former who deserts the mss. 101 preconceivcd
general rules, 01 Lachmann who here also is content 10 obey the best
evidence he can getl Ihavc unhesitatingly come over to the views 01
the latter: ‘hypotheses non fingo' should be the rule in this as in other
matters. Aa said above, all these uncertain spellings 1111 under 1 very
few general heads. One 01 these 111111111111111ιί0101101-1111111111101
01 prepositions : inpare represents the etymology, impero the pronuncia-
tion 01 the word. From the most ancient period 01 which we have any
record, centurias before Cicero or Lucretius, a compromise was made be- ’
tween these opposing interests: words in common use 1001 began 10
change the consonant, those in less common use retained it longer. In
the first volume 01 the corpus inscrip. Lat, the most recent of which
are as old as the age of 111011111111101101 them much older, impe·
rator occurs 26 times, and is always spelt with m, proving that in a
