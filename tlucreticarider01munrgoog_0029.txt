¹ (110010000οἀ00000100100100001000101011. Victorius says 01 yraado
in v 1192 ‘glande 10 Ρο01. libro’: now since not only the Venice
edition, but the Verona and first Aldine have grando, and also 110 Bres-
cian as Ι learn from Earl Spencer's librarian, Pantanus must have used
some printed edition now unknown. The pains which 00 eminent a
scholar as Victorius has taken in copying out twice the emendations 01
Ρο010000 001 0000 11000 01 Marullus would prove 110 high estimation in
which those two learned meu must have been held when he was a young
man 01 twenty. As 10100 0100111010 copy of 110 1001100 0111 long
parallel passages from the Greek, he must himself at one time have
contemplated an elaborate edition 01 110 poet and has 10 10 added 10
110 long 110101 scholare with whom this remained an unaooomplished
design.

We have then an undoubted copy 01 0101 Fontanus himself asserted
1010 110000 original emendations3 001 00 they are accurately repeated
by Victorius in his second copy, 11 00 subtract these 00 1000 10 what
remains 110 001001101 corrections of Marullus. Now the latter with
only a few variations, easily to 10 000000101 for as being earlier thoughts
0010 other ways, all reappear among the alterations 01 110 Μο0101 ms.
which are however much more numerous. When we consider all this,
and remember that wherever (10011100 10 110 00100 mentions the name
01 Marullus, 110 reading which he assigna to him 10 found here3 that 10
10110 00 10 110 pref-ace his text is grounded mainly on 110 revisions 01
Pontanus and Marullus, the latter more especially; that, 00 110 present
edition will demonstrate, the numerous readings which first appear 10110
J untine, good bad 001 indifferent, where not taken from what 00 000
know 10 10 11000 01 Ρο010000, nearly always agree with 110 corrections
01 1110 manuscript 3 and finally that Candidus not unfrequently gives 0
new reading peculias to 1110 01 011 manuscripts known 10 me, 00 10 110
0010 10 v 826 where he mentions pariendo as a variation, we may fairly
conclude 1101 Candidus in preparing bis text had the 000 01 1110 corrected
manuscript, and that 110 ¹corrector was Marullus It would 10 natural
too 10 00001010 1101 1110 10 110 own copy amended by his own hand3 and
for the most part Ι 10 001 10011 1101 thiais οο. However they cannot
all have been written 01 110 same time, as 110 ink differs in different ,
places3 and 00 so many 01 110 emendations agree with those of Pantanus,
it seems not improbable 1101 110 ms. was in his possession before it came
into 1101001001 Marullus. As the italien handwritings 011101 age re-
semble each other so much, at least to our eyes, the writing 01 110 pupil
may not have differed much from that 01 110 master. However that
may be, we must conclude that the corrections common to 1011 belong
to Pantanus, 00 10 000 110 elder and 00 saw above that he claims them
for his own, and the scholar would naturally borrow from the master.
