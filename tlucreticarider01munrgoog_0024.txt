the capture of his native city he was brought to Italy, probably to
Ancona. He received his training however in Florence, and he found a
Maecenas in Inrenzo de’ Medici. Though he never printed anything
on Lucretius, his manuscript emendations appear to bave been well
known during his life, and a copy of the poet to have been found on him
at his death: ‘ex miseranda illa in mediis 00011100 undis Latinarum
musarum iactura cladeque insigni unus est Lucretius receptus' says Oan-
didus in his preface 3 and his friend Petrus Crinitus in his dehoneste
disciplina xv 4, published in 1504, but mostly written it would seem
before Marullus' death, after well refuting an alteration 01 his which
shall presently be referred 10, adds ‘quae ab eius quoque sectatoribus
recepta sunt pro verissimis'. This intense love of Lucretius he seems
only 10 have conoeived in the latter years 01 his life. Candidus, whose
preface full of feeling shews that he greatly loved Marullus and deeply
deplored his untimely end, strives to make the most of what he did: be

published without 0 date, but not later than 1490, containing only two ¹

books 01 epigrama, shows 00 far as I can see no truce 01 any acquaintance
with Lucretius. Catullus is chiefly imitated ewen in the elegiace, and

before his death, he published at Florence a much eularged edition. A
third and fourth book 01 epigrama are added: in these too Ι find no

these, especially such as are written in harcies, the strain is ‘ 01 0 higher

lyrics, as Opibasque 1010 polleas 1010 which reoalls Ipsa 0010 pollens opi-
