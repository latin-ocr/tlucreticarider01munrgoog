22 INTRODUCTION

, he appears to have once had thoughts of doing, there is no doubt that

Lucretius would have owed him much. The impulse given by Lachmann
to the study 01 our poet has called forth numerous papers either inserted
in the German philological reviews or published by themselves. Some
are 01 more, some 01 1000 importance: my notes will shew where I ha've
¹ been indebted to them. One English publication 01 eminent merit, as it
criticises not the text of the poem, but its matter and poetical beauties,
shall be mentioned elsewhere.

Το return now to the manuscripts whose history was sketched above.
Th0ugh I examined the two at Leyden for some days so long ago as the
autumn of 1849, what will now be said 01 them is borrowed from
Lachmann who had them in his hands for six months and during that
time applied the whole force 01 his practised and penetrating intellect to
· umavelling all their difficulties and obscurities. Both, 00 already men·
tioned, belonged to the magnificent collection of Isaac Vossius. The
older and better 01 the two is 01 the ninth century written in aclear and ’
beautiful hand: Ι 0011 11 A. It has been corrected by two scribes at the
time that the ms. was written, as Lachmann tells us. One 01 these is of
great-importance: in most essential points he agrees minutely with the
ms. 01 11100011, 11ιο oldest 01 the Italian mss. ; and doubtless therefore
gives the reading of the archetype. It will be seen in notes 1 how often
I make the united testimony of A and Niccoli to cutweigh 011 the rest.
The other Leyden ms. which I call B is of nearly equal importasse: it
is 01 quarto size closely written in double columns, apparently in the
tenth century. It is probable that it and the ms. next to be mentioned
were copied from some copy 01 the archetype, not like A from the arche·
type itself. Four portions 01 the poem are omitted in their place, but
come together at the end in this order, 11 757-806 v aas-979 1 7 34-
785 11 253-304. Lachmann has demonstrated that these sections
formed each an entire leaf of the lost archetype: 16 29 39 115 arethe
numbers 01 these leaves It is manifest then that after A was copied,
these leaves 01 the archetype had fallen out of their places and been put
together without order at the end, before B, or the original 01 Β, was
copied from it More will be said on this point presently. B has had
several correctors, but 011 01 the ldth century; one a very brilliant critic
’ for his age, to whom are due many 01 the finest emendations 10 the poem,
as will be 0000 10 00100 l. This ms. was once in the great monastery 01
St. Bertin near St. Omer. Turnebus collated it in Paris and his colla-
11οο 00 00 000 was used with much effect by Lambinus: it afterwards
came into the possession of Gerard John Vossius, Isaac’s father. A
large fragment of another ms. closely resembling B in everything double
columns and all, except that it is said to be a small folio, not quarto in
shape‚ is now at Oopcnhagen: it contains book 1 aud 11 down 10456,
omitting however the same sections as B, viz. 1 734-785 aud 11 253-
