34 INTRODUCTION

word, which must daily have been in cverybody’s mouth, etymology in ,
remote times yieldecl as was natural to sound: imperium again occurs
three, inperium six times, being doubtless in somewhat less common use.
Now in Lucretius imperium impero or imperito occurs six times, and
the mss. always spell with ni, and so Lucretius spelt I have no doubt:
indeed many of these common words tha silver agc Ι believe more
frequently wrote with n, than did that of Cicero, Thau Virgil uses int-
perium 40 times; and Ribbeck's capital mss. have nu in every instance,
except M which twice has inp, though one of these two cases is at least
doubtful: for Aen. vm 381 Fogginius prints imperiis. Yet in defiauce
of all this evidence Wagner gives us inperium, surely without reason on
any view of the case3 for the foundation on which we must build isthus
withdrawn from under our feet. To take another common instance,
commuto occurs 9 times in the corpus inscrip. and always with ra, 12 times
in Lucretius and always with na Other words are more uncertain: we
find in the mss. impius and inpius, inarmrtatis and inosculatio, contigere
and colligere, compleo and coaptes, and so with other propositione, ab, ob,
sub, ad: all tending to prove that usage was in most words uncertain.
Again we have custo, and erto, easoluo, exulto eupiro expecto cet, s being
generally omitted 3 and this agrees with Quintilian 1 7 4 who implies
that it was a learned affectation of some to write euspecto in order to dis·
tinguish eu and specto from, eu and pecto; it agrees too with all other
good evidence: the mss. of Virgil furnish precisely the same testimony
as those of Lucretius3 yet Wagner in all such cases writes eus: surely
we should keep eu where the mss. keep it, eae where they have eus: and
so with supter or subter, suptilis or subtilis, ab- or up, ob· or op, ueh- or
sup, uice- or susc, and the like: appareo occurs ten times in Lucr. and
is always spelt thus by our mss: so appara appello (both 1 and 3conj.) ; .
but adpetitur and always culpano, adporto or otperto, in which words the
separate force of the preposition continued to be felt: in exact conform-
ity with this the first volume of the corp. inser. has twenty times appareo
and also apparitor, proving that in the earliest times the prepos. had
been assimilated in this common technical word: thus too in the 21 in-

¹ stances of appareo in Virgil all Ribbeck's mss. always have opp. except

M once, Aen. x1 605, misled by the usage of its age: comp. the sugges·
tive remark of Servius to Aen. 1 616 ‘applicat : secundum praesentem
usum perd prima syllaba scribitur: secundum antiquam orthographiam
...per p ' : yet in defiance of all this Wagner makes Virgil always write
adpareo and the like. We find baud and haut, and sometimes aliut ali-
quit quicquit and the like, sound and etymology carrying on an undecided
battle in the mss. of Lucretius, as iu inscriptions and elsewhere : adqiie
is sometimes but rarely found, sound having here as might be expected
gained the victory : Wagner cannot he right in always forcing adque on
Virgil. Lucretius seems to have recognised only sed: he once has ekubsu
