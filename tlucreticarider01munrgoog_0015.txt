' much to the well-pondered remarks of Mr N. P. Howard‚ whose letter to

me I have printed in the first number of the new Journal of Philology 3

⁸ and, especially in the third and fourth bookS, to the communications of

my friend Professor J. E. B. Mayor, to whose notes I have appended his
initials.
In the aoth and 26tlr volumes of the Philologus there is a long
‘ Jahresbericht' by Mr Fried. Polle on the Lucretius literature after
Lachmann and Bernays3 and some remarks oi his occur in J ahn's J ahr-
buecher. He hardly touches on the interpretation or philosophy of the
poet nor have I been able to adopt any oi his own conjectures which are
Ι not very numerous. The most valuable hint I have got from him is on
’ v 312, though my own correction is very different from his. In several
volumes of the same Philologus appear very prolix notes on the earlier
books by Mr Susemihl and Mr Brieger. The former confines himself
chiefly to rearranging paragraphs and to proposing numerous transpo-
sitione of verses, in neither Ι. think with much success. Many of his
new arrangements of paragraphs are I essert demonstrably wrong; and

his violent transpositions would lead to the wildest confusion. Once

however I have obeyed him in not making a new paragraph of 1v168-

175 : it was an accident that this was not done before, as my attention

, was absorbed in refuting Lachmann’s errors there. Mr Brieger, who is

the more combative of the two, indulges mainly in conjectural alterations

oi the text. Once or twice I have referred-to Mr Holtze's ‘Syntaxis

· Lucretianae lineamenta'

On the whole my oriticism is now I believe more conservative than
it was. Again and againI have found that, seduced by the learning of
Lachmann, I have followed him in changes which really corrupt the
author. This must hold then in many other cases as well. If the text of

Virgil rested, like that of Lucretius, on a single manuscript, how much

Ἴ there is in him we should refuse to accept as Latin! This ‘must give

us pause' Yet Ι have not sinned Ι think in defending the indefensible.
