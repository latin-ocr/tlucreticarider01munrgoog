. inserts two new verses in 1116 poem ‘de poetis Latinis' spoken 61 above,
Natura 166961 uersibus Leccretii Lepore musaeo illitis, the best in the
poem and recalling musaeo 6661166666 666616 lepore. Crinitus l.l. xx111
7 quotes this poem and mentions a conversation he had with Marullus
in which ‘iactum est iudicium nuper a nostro Marullo de poetis Latinis
egregie perfectum et prudenter’, and Ovid and other poets are blamed ;
and then it is added ‘itaque legendi quidem sunt omnes inquit [Marul-
lus] 3 sed hi maxime probandi pro suo quisque genere Tibullus Horatius
Catullus et in comoedia Terentius. Vergilium vero et Lucretium edis-
ceedor asseretct’, Let what 1166 just been said be at once applied to a
striking interpolation. After 1 15 the J untine first inserted the v. Ille-
cedrisque 1616616611 natura 66116661661,11111611 long kept its place in
111666111111611 editions. Lachmann 61 course attributes 1116 Marullus, as
do most editors. Lambinus says oi it ‘neque eum Naugerius neque
Pontanus habuerunt. Marullus unus vir doctus ex auctoritate veteris
’ cuiusdam codicis, quemadmodum mihi religiose asseveravit Donatus
Ianottus‚ nobiseum restituit. amicus quidam meus ingenio et doctrina
praestantissimus putat esse ab ipso Marullo factum cet'. What his
authority is ior that which he says of Pontanus Ι do not know, but Nau-

. gerius editor oi the Aldine of 1515 properly omits the line, though he

in general minutely copies 1116 J untine, N ow this line is written by the
hand of Angelo Politian in the margin 61 6 manuscript which belonged
to him and forms xxxv 29 61 the Laurentina library. Politian died in
September 1494, when Marullus corrld hardly yet have done much 161
Lucretius 3 and besides this as 116 had been long the deadly enemy oi
Politian, it is not likely the latter would have inserted in his manuscript
· one 61 his verses I infer therefore that it is Politian's own3 and as
Candidus says in his preface that 116 collated all the ‘vetusta exemplaria’
in Florence, 116 could not have neglected this manuscript which was
then in the famous' conventual library 61 San Marco. Iconclude therefore
that Candidus’ taking it from the margin oi Politian's ms. 16 the right
explanation 61 Ianottus’ assertion that Marullus got it from an ancient
codex, It 16 quite possible indeed that Marullus copied it himself from ι
this ms. which passed to San Marco immediately aiterPolitian's decease,
and thus robbed him 61 his verse aiter death, 66 he is said to have
robbed him 61 his bride during 1116. Naugerius has in 1116 first page
another variatiou from the J untine, but that a perverse one: in 1 7 he
reads Adventuque 166 and joina it with what follows. This corruption
I believe tc proceed irum Marullus; for his hymn to the sun contains a
passage evidently imitated 116111 Lucretius: 0616 primum tepidi sub
16166616 66166 favoni Aura 16661 terrie genitalem esuccitut auctum:
Adventuque dei gemmetic pratu colorat: Ar 66661669611666616661661,
