and made the best approximation he could to what his author might have
written, always taking thc most ancient form 101 which his authorities
supplied any testimony direct or indirect. Thus the question was not
foreclosed3 1101 were wc left to vaguc generalities, but a firm historica]
groundwork was gained upon which future improvements might bc built,
if better evidence hereafter offered itself. Lachmann then in this, as in
so many other departments of philology, seems at once to have produced,
conviction 111 the minds 01 the majority 01 the most thoughtlul scholars,
in Germany Ι mean, 1011110111 own country most seem to scout the
question as unworthy 01 00110110 attention: agreat mistake3 101 Latin
orthography is a most interesting and valuable study to those who care
to examine it, and touches in 0 thousand points the history grammar and
pronunciaticn 01 the language. Let me give two examples 01 the effect
01 once produced by Lachmann. Otto Jahn in 1843 published his
elaborate edition 01 Persius in which 110 adopted throughout the spelling
then in common use, though he had so many excellent 1110010 guide him
10 0 better course : in 1851, the year 01101 Lachmann's work came out,
hc published the text 01 his Juvenal andiollowed 1111111100111111111101)1
the principles 01 Lachmann 3 and fortunately he had 0 111001 excellent
authority in 1110 codex Pithoeanus; so that the spelling is probably not
very 101 removed 110111 the author's own. In the years just preceding
Lachmann Halm published several orations 01 Cicero with elaborate
critical Latin notes 5 and yet, though his spelling was somewhat better
than that 01 J ahn's Persius, it is still essentially ‘conventional' and arbi-
trary: in the years following Lachmann he published 0 001100 01 school
editions 01 Oicero's orations with brief German notes, and now in these
the spelling was wholly modelled on the system pursued by Lachmann.
The same system too he has carried out in those volumes 01 the elaborate
edition 01 Cicero edited by him and Baiter, which came out after Lach-
mann’s Lucretius, Stimulated by the examples 01 Madvig Ritschl and
Lachmann the rising generation 01 German scholare has pursued thc
critical study 01 Latin w'ith eminent success, and nearly all 01 them 101-
low in orthography the guidance 01 Lachmann. This system then may
fairly I think be now regarded 00 111011001000100110110101010111, 101
surely the Lachmanns and Ritschls 01 the nineteenth century have a
better right to dictate 10 110 111 the present day what shall be accepted as
‘conventional' 1111111 the Poggios and Vallas 01 the fiftecnth. Since my
first edition came 0111, Madvig has published the last books 01 his text 01
Livy, 01 which there exists but a single and very ancient ms: these he
has edited in a 101111 differing 110111 that 01 the other 110010, and has now
given his very weighty authority in favour of adhering to the spelling 01
the oldest mss, with some reservations which I do 1101 understand And
now too in his new edition 01 the de finibus he has entirely abandoned
the orthography 01 the other.
