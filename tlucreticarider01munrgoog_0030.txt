the appearance of being earlier and more rudimentary than those of 1115
other: he not unfrequently too sees that something is wanting and says
‘fragmentum ³, where the latter supplies a whole verse with 111015 01 1555
success. The scholar therefore completed what the master commenced3
and the emendation of Lucretius links their names together not 1555
honourably than does the verse we quoted from Ariosto. Upon the whole
this fresh information has greatly raised my estimate of both, especially
of Marullus. His industry is at least as conspicuous as his sagacity: he
has evidently carefully collated manuscripts and editions 51111 gethered
materiale from all accessible sources. Throughout the poem the many
verses omitted in the Munich manuscriptam supplied with unfailing
diligence. He evidently was acquainted with several of the ·existing
Florentino manuscripts3 among others that of Niccoli I believe, es well
as that 01 his enemy Politian, and Flor. 31 whose readings Lachmann 50
strangely assigna to the notary Antonius Marii. Upon the whole he
must be placed as an emender 01 Lucretius immediately after Lambinus
- and Lachmann, if 1101 indeed in the same frent rank, when we consider
the circumstances 01 his age end the imperfectiori 01 his materials 3 and
Pontanus perhaps may rank after 111111. Lambinus, as well as Avancius
and Naugerius editor of the second Aldine, must have had access tc some
copy of Pontanus' corrections. ’

What Ι said of Marullus in my first edition with much more imper-
fect materials from which to draw eopclusions, I find now confirmed in
essential points. There were in circulation different copies of Marullus'
emendations ; Gifanius had access to one of these: see notes 1 101 27 4
11 1005, as well as 11 16 125 4651119941201 1151 11251 what Ι 111-
ferred fromvhis own poems is 1101115 out by 11 719 and 749 and some
011151 passages: 1115555511101101 Crinitus quoted above that Marullus had
corrupted 11 651 652 is fully confirmed here: Marullus for the correct
5151155155 most unskilfully proposes 11111110 aalma ; 5111011015155115
511 : 1115 151151 Candidus adopts. In other cases hs more mature judg-
ment as seen in the Munich manuscript doubtless differed from his earlier
notione. A man who studied Lucretius so long and earnestly cannot
fail to heve often changed his mind on further reflexion and with new

sources of information. Candidus does not by any means follow Ponta- '

11115 01 Marullus in his orthography: that is formed 551 proved 111 my
first edition mainly on Avancius. Ι11 many cases they might have taught
him hetter; to avoid for instance such embellishments as his 51511515,
5115111515. Η5 rightly however avoids such barbarisms as the hymbrae
and sylva of Marullus. From saccus littam arctas aad the 11115, which
the latter carefully introduces, we may infer that he and Pantanus had
some share in bringing such corruptions into common use, The careful
collation which I have given in 11115 edition 01 the emendations of
Fontanus and Marullus will prove their importunes, aud shew how 15511
