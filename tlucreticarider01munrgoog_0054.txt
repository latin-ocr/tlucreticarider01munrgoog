spelling therefore uncertain, such 00 the penult of superlativas and cer-

the guidance 01 001 mss. which only 0000 101 instance have u in the 00-

who, Gellius tells 00, first introduced the a‘ 101 u in superlatives, invaria-

to reproduee the spelling 01 Lucretius or his first editorl Certainly not,
but still in most 01 them Lucretius and his contemporaries undoubtedly
allowed themselves much latitude; and I have not intentionally permit-
ted anything to remain which might not have been found in 0110 01011101

the other hand, after feasting on the genereus 0010010 01 a Lachmann and
a Ritschl, can I stomach the ‘conventional’ husks and acorns 01 the
Italians 01 the l5th century. At the same time it will be 00011 that my
