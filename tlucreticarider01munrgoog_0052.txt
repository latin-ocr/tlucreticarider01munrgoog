and once praeseribta: see notes 2 to vr 92: in such forms sound must
have at an early period prevailed 3 and b d q gave way top t e before s
and t: lapsus lor labens is the same principle as ren· (ress), rexi (recsi)
written sometimes reensi, reetnrn from repo: to judge from the best mss.
labans and the like became again much more common in the silver age.
Mommsen has recently published an admirable copy end exposition ol
the res gestae of Augustus from the Ancyra monument. Augustus was
somewhat of a purist in spelling and eashicred an officer for using in a
dispateh the vulgariam isse (not ine) instead of ipse. His system quite
bears out what has just been said: he always writes imperinmandinnpe-
rat0r3 he has immortalis, but inmissus 3 impensa, while the heading oi
the work, not written by him, but perhaps by Tiberius, bas inpensa:
generally eonteqa and conlegium, but once collegium and collaticiae 3 eail'
nm, but exstinquere 3 on the other hand sensiens as well assentiens, prov-
ing that n and ers were identical: he writes appellaverant3 but adque
the only time he uses the word.

Another question involving a multitude of details is the use 'os -e's or
-es in the accus. plur. of participles and adjectives and substantives
whose gen. plur. ends in inm, as well as of some other classes doloris or
doleres, maioris or maiores: here too Wagner involves himself in inex-
tricable perplexities by his eclectio system, when his mss were admirable
guides, had ho chosen te follow them. The mss. of Lueretius are no less
admirable and probably represent very fairly the author’s own usage:
they offer -is five times out of six3 and ·es is somewhat more common in
substantives in very general use, as iqnes eires annea Inscriptions quite
bear out our mss. 3 and the sole relic of Latin yet disinterred from Her-
culaneum contains this v. Utraque sollemnis iterum revocaverat orbes.
Pertz recently printed in the Berlin transactione the few remaining ·
leaves of a ms. of Virgil, wbich he assigns to the age of Augustus and
which may really be of the second or third century: we there find the
acc. plur. ol adjectives and participles ending 18 times in -is, 3 times in
-es peres felices necantes 3 of substantives we find sonoris, but 4 times
eires, and artes messes crates classes aves, quite confirming the testimony
of our A and B. Varro de ling. Lat. v111 66 writes item qnod impetrire Ἰ
casn ltoe yenns dispariliter dicatur civitatum parentum et civitatium pa·
rentium: in accusandi hos montes fontes et fios montis fontis3 and in
Lucr. 11 587 we find potestates, v 1239 potestatis: then ib. 67 he says
qnid potest similius esse qnam gens mens densi qnam berane casnspntri-
cns et ocensatinns in multitudine sint disponitis 3 nom n primo fit gen-

tium et gentis, utrobique nt se't i3 ab secando mentium et mentes, nt in
priore solo sit i 3 ab tertio dentum et dentes, nt in nentre sit i 3 well our
mss. six times have the aec. gentis, never 'pentes3 dentes four times,
never dentis3 mentes five times, once only, 11 eramentu. As for the
nemin. plur. ol such words, Varro 1. l. 66 says sine reprehensione ruho elii
