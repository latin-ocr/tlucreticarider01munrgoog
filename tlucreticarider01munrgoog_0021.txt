01 little, others 01 greater importauce; for example 1v las-190 are
wanting in the Verona, but not in the Venice. The reason why I dwell
ἱ cn this 1001 will appear presently.

In December 1500 Aldus published bis first edition of onr poem, the
iirst systematic endeavour tc make it intelligible throughout. The editor
was Hieronymus Avancius 01 Verona, who dates bis dedication ‘Kalen-
dis Martii nro', old style Ι presumo, and really therefore 1500: an
interval 01 twenty-two months between the two dates would not be easy
to understand. Avancius is known by other works also, especially the
Aldine edition 01 Catullus. A slight inspection will shew that he took
either the Verona or the Venice edition, upon which to form bis text 3 a
more careiul examination will prove that it must have been the latter.
My critical notes will furnish many other instances; let me here only
mention that in 111 994 hc and Ven. bave torpedine 101 cuppedine, while
Ver. reads turpidine3 1011 be takes from Ven. its remarkable reading
syenae, which lachmann adopts and wrongly assigna to Marullus: Ver.
follows the Leyden and all other known mss. in reading 0901100 ; 1015110
and Ven. have the abeund reading 1111111010 101 laclia, where Ver. has the
equally unmeaning 11010. Ven. therefore is the ‘ante impressus' spoken
01 by Aldus. Avancius' preface shews that 101 his day be was 0 good
and well-read Latin scholar, and had studied Priscian Nonius and Ma
crebius 101 the illustration 01 his author. Aldus in his prefatcry letter
to Albertus Pius confirms this, and says that he knew Lucretius by
beart, ‘ut digitos unguesque suos’. Avancius in his preface asserta
much the same; and the 1011 01111001 remarks he there inserts shcw that
this was true at least to a certain extent. At the same time he admits
with a seeming candour that owing tc the immense difficulty 01 the
work he bas lest much for others to do. Much indeed he has left un·
done 3 and it would have been a herculean task 101 one man fully 10 cor·
rect the desperately corrupt Venice edition, especially in those days
when there were but 1011 extraneous aids and tbe art 01 systematis criti-
cism was still in its infanoy, two generations having yet 1ο elapsa, before
it reached its full growtb in the hands 01 the illustrious school 01 French
critias. What be has donc however is very great and entitles him to
high praise, 1111 10 indeed his own. But this shall be considered pre·
sently. The next edition is that 01 the well-known scholar Ioannes Bap
tista Pius, published 1511 ‘kal Maii' in his native Bologna Lucretius'
text is embedded in an enormous commentary which displays amid much
cumbrous learning no slight acquaintance witb the Latin poeta, several
01 which he edited before and 01101 his Lucretius. He thus describes
what he bas done: ‘contulimus non sine aerumnis vigiliisque diutinis
codicem veneti Hermolai: 01 Pomponi romani: codicemque non omnino
malum: qui servatur Mantuae in bibliotheca quadam suburbana: qui
suit viri non indocti gentis clarissimae Stratiorum. non deluit Philippi
