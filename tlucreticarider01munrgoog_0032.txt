the field 61 conjecture, and 161 nearly three centurias his remained the
standard text. Lachmann says 116 616 much less than Marullus. But
so far as there 16 116111 111 this, it 16 merely saying that the one lived
before the other: niue tenths 61 what Marullus affected, Lambinus could
have 66116 currente calamo ; but I doubt whether Marullus could have
accomplished one tenth 61 what Lambinus succeeded in doing. Lach-
mann accuses him 61 strange levity and rashness. But it must be re·
membered that in a short life 116 got through 611 amazing amount 61
work in conformity with the wants 61 his age. He only gave two years
and a half to his brilliant edition 61 the whole 61 Cicero: and probably
did not spend many more months on his Lucretius than Lachmann spent
years. Nor was it possible in that age even 161 6 Lambinus to appre-
hend the true relation 61 the 11166 61 Lucretius to one another. His
copious explanatory and illustrative commentary however calls 161 un-
qualified eulogy, and has remained down to the present day the great
original storehouse‚ 116111 which all have borrowed who have done any-
thing of velue 161 the elucidation 61 their author. Scaliger says ‘Iam-
binus avoit fort peu de livres': il so he made good use 61 them, as his
reading is as vast as it is accurate, and its results are given in a style 61
unsurpassed clearness and beauty. His notes observe the mean between
166 much and too little: he himself calls them 111161, while 1116 thankless
countrymen‚ thinking however more perhaps 61 his Horace than 1116 Lu-
cretius, have made 1616616 and lambiner classieal 161166 16 express what
is diffuse and tedicus A second and much smaller edition with only a
few peges of notes, but with many variatione 116111 the first, was pub-'
lished in 1565.

Searcely could this first edition have issued from the prese, when the
well-known scholar and jurisconsult Obertus Gitanius of Buren began
with systematical and unprincipled cunning to pillage it and convert it
to his own purposes. His Lucretius was printed by Plautinos Antwerp
in 1566 66616166 6111166116, though 61 two copies 1161616 me thc title·
page 616116 hasen it 1566, the other 1565, which 16 thc date 61 his own
address 16 Sambucus, and 61 the two privilegia at the end; for the
March 1564 61 the first must 116 616 style, as it is later than the Febru-
ary 156561 the second. He brought nothing new 16 his task, except
the ms. notes 61 Marullus in the old Venice ed. fully spoken of above;
for the emendations and readings 61 Antonius Goldingamus homo An·
glus, which 116 speaks 61 111 his preface, and the ceteros 11611666 the like
which occur throughout his hook are mere blinds to conceal his 1116116
116111 Lambinus. The way in which 116 contrives at once to bestow
empty praise 611 this scholar and yet 16 extenuate his menits 6116 put him
as a commentator 61 Lucretius on the same level with other learned
rnen, Turnebus 161 instance, isa marvel 61 astuteness. In the preface to
his third ed. Lambinus states the truth with great terseness: ‘omnia
