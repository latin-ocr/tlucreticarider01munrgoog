spacium, speciei or epatica was eorrect; and consequently as a rule chose
the wrong. Their general principles however were not accepted by the
most thoughtful scholare in any age, so far at least as concerned the text
of ancient authors, unless it be during a part of the present century3
neither hyan Avancius in the l5th nor hya Lambinus or Scaliger in
the ldth nor by a Gronovius in the 17 th nor by a Bentley in the 18th.
Yet this system gradually established itself, because it came to be used
by scholars in their own writings, some of the barbarisms being gradu-
ally eliminated 3 new ones however being introduced, such as coelura
coena moereo tylon caetera for caelum cena maereo siloa cetero in order to
derive them preposterouely from Greek words: Marullus, as we said
above, writes sylva and hymbrae.

Many attempta were made in various directions to change this state
of things: the best and most systematic was that of Ph. Wagner in his
orthographia Vergiliana published in 1841. With admirable industry
he amassed all the evidence-ufforded hythe mediceae aud, so far as it
was accessible to him, of the other ancient mss. of Virgil As these, like
’ other old mss, are as a rulo very tenacious of the true spelling in those
cases where there is only one right method, he performed this part of his
work with eminent success, and still remains one of the best authorities
on the subject. In those other cases however referred to above, in which
variety is the rule of the ancients and which include a great multitude
of particular instances, he has chosen to abandon the safe ground of evi-
dence and experience and has made Virgil write what he decided on a
priori principles he must have written. This seems to me the reason
why his system was not more generally followed. Still less satisfactory
was Madvig's spelling in his de finibus published in 1839: it was utterly
unlike that of the mss. and yet in many points it was not what Cicero
used; in still more you could not be sure whether it was what he used
or not. Here too Lachmann bringing into play his extraordinary ‘power
of esking the right question’, and joining with it a minute knowledge of
the whole evidence upon the subject, saw at once what could be obtained
and what could not, and sheped his course accordingly. The Leyden
mss. of Lucretius imperfect in many respects, are on the whole admira-
ble in their orthography, at least equal to any of the mss. of Virgil, con-
firming them in what is true and confirmed by them in turn: in some
nice points, euch as the frequent retention of the enclitie et, they far
surpass them. With their aid he was able to confirm those improve-

ments in spelling which Wagner had so well established in opposition to '

the system in common use. But in regard to the other class of words in
which the usage of the ancients varied in different ages or even in the
same age, he did not dogmatically determine what his author wrote and
thus close the door to all future change 3 but knowing that certainty was

not here attainable, he carefully sifted the evidence offered¹ by his mss.
