the minutest points of spelling and punctuation. The latter for instance
says in his preface that he writes ‘veteres imitatus repertumst, itemst,
‘coacescat' and the like: Candidus in his preface that ‘in tam cult0, tam
nitido, tam undecunque castigato poeta' he will not admit archaisms
like calaum, uolnera ; or nullast, haudquaquamst and the like. And
so in his text while rejecting Avancius' patefactast, uoluere, etc, he
keeps his frugiferentum, capuceis and a thousand such forms which have
no authority in their favour, while those which he discards have much.
Lachmann always so hard upon Avancius says ‘huius ineptissimam
scribendi rationem Eichstadius studiose imitatus est’, but has not a word
os blame for Candidus.

But whence has the latter got his many and brilliant correctionst
for few or none appear to come from himself. He says in his address to
Thomas Sotherinus that what he did was to collate all the uetusta
exemplaria that were in Florence and to expungo what was condemned
by the obeli of Pontanus and Marullus ‘praestantissimorum aetate nos
tra vatum’. He refers of course to John Iovianus Pontanus and his
friend and pupil Michael Marullus, after Politian two of the first scho
lars and Latin poets' of the most fiourishing period of Florentino
learning, the latter half of the fifteenth century: ‘Marullo edil Pontan’
have the honour to bementioned together by Ariosto in the Orlando
xxxvu 8. But Candidus goes on afterwards to speak only of Marullus
‘cuius in hoc opere censuram potissimum secuti sumus’3 and in a note
at the end he says that in changing the order of verses here and in most
other places he has followed the arrangement of Marullus. Το Marullus
therefore everything which is peculiar to the J untine has usually been
assigned, whether in the way of praise, or of blame as by Victorius
and by J oseph Scaliger who inherited among many other of his father's
antipathies his dislike to Marullus But Lachmann has gone much
further than this, and has given to him not only by oversight, as will bc
seen in notes 1, much that belongs to older authorities, but everything
that first appeared in Avancius’ edition as well, calling the latter ‘fur
improbus' and other opprobrious names That he got much assistance
from the labours of Marullus is certain 3 but by ascribing to the latter
everything that is in the Juntine, in some respects more, in others less
creditis given to him than he deserves. As Ι can throw some light on
this interesting question, Iwill examine it at some length here and in
various parts of notes 1.

The scholar, poet and soldier, Michael Tarchaniota Marullus Gon-
stantiuopolitauus, as he calls himself in the editions of his poems
printed during his life, appears from this title and his epitaph in San
Domenieo of Ancona, where he and so many of his ancestors are buried,
as well as from the epithet Bizantius given to him by his friend Petrus
(trinitus, to have been born in Constantinople. As he can hardly
