fere quae in 00 Lucretio 10010 sunt, mes sunt ; quae tamen iste aut si-'

Yet so grmt was the skill with which all this was done that he deceived
many and was thought- to be a wortby rival 01 Iambinus Contrary to
what many believe, the age loved brief notes ; and his were 1111011110
other’s eopious. Even the great critic 01 that generation J oseph Scali-
ger, who well knew the character 01 the man and 1100110011 him 01 gross
deecit towards himself, says ‘Gifanius estoit docte, son anrboe est 1110-
bon ’. Lambinus however knew 1110 tratis, and his wrath was as signal
as the provocation. In 1570 110 brought out a third edition greatly im-
proved and enlarged 3 much 01 the additional matter however consists in
invectives against the aggressor. In a long preiaoe 01 great power and
beauty of style he 010100 his wrongs Τ11010 and throughout his commen-
tary the whole Latin language‚1icb in that department, is ransacked for
terms 01 000111 and contumely. The same charges are repeated in a hun-
dred different shapes with curious copiousness and variety 01 expression.
Gitanius with consistent cunning attempted no publio reply 10 all this.
Many years afterwards, when Lambinus had long been dead, a new edi-
tion 01 the other’s book was brought out at Ieyden in 1595, in which
many additions are made 10 the brief notes, but not a word is said of the
charges brought against him by Lambinus He was rewarded 101 his
reticente, and 101 a century 01 more opinion was divided as 10 whether
he 01 Lambinus did more 101 Lucretius. In private 110 corresponded
with the cankered and uuhappy Muretus: the two exchanged futile
'charges 01 dishonesty against the dead 011110, who was ‘far 100 genuine a
scholar to be capable of being a plagiary. Lachmann so stern with
Avancius has nothing 10 say 01 this much more flagitious case: ‘quiquo
iure' he observes ‘aut Lambinum aut alios compilasse dictus esset non
quaesivi ’. Gifanius had no business whatever 10 edit a poet: 110 was
without poetical taste and grossly ignorant 01 1110110. ’
For a century aster Lambinus nothing was 1100010111001011001 1110
common editions followed either Lambinus or Gifanius. In 1658 the
singular labours 01 Gassendi were given 10 the world. Deeply versed iu
the works of the fathers and the philosophy 01 all ages down to 1110 101001 5
discoveries 01 Descartes he devoted himself with the zeal of a disciple 10 1
the dogmas 01 Epicurus. The two first of his huge 101100 are given to
tbis'philosophy, and 0 large portion 01 1110111 10 the exposition 01 Lucre-
tius. Much that is curious may be gathered from them, and I have
perused them with attention ; but to say 1110 1111111 Ι have not found
much to my purpose in 1110111. The author was utterly devoid of the
critical faculty, and all that is 01 value in him on this head is horrowed

rections 01 1110 text 010 almost without exception worthless. In 1110 17111
