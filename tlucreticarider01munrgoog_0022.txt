Beroaldi praeceptoris quondam mei: nune collegae: impressus quidem :
sed tamen perpense examinatus Codri quoque grammatici Bononiensis:
cuius eopia mihi per Bartholomeum Blanchinum virum eloquii excultis-
aimi facta est: Marullique poetae industria mira castigatum non defuit
exemplar Severo Mouaeo Placentino graece latineque perdocto musarum
athleta non gravatim offerente’. He makes no mention at all 01 theman
to whom he was most indebted, Avancius: 101 his textis a reprint 01 the
first Aldine, with however not a few changes 01 words or phrases, often
101 1110 better, often 101 the worse, either inserted in the text or pro
posed in the notes, and derived it may be presumed in many cases 110111
one or other 01 the sources just mentioned. But strange to say when he
makes a change in the text, the lemma 01 his note nearly always con·
teins not this reading, but that 01 Avancius as ii he had meant it to ·
stand: thus 1 9 he rightly reads dr'pffoeo 100111ος but his lemma has dif-
saeo numine with Avancius, which the latter however correcta at the
end 01 his Catullus: and he adds ‘sunt qui legunt lamiae’. 15 for
copta he wrongly inserts in the text quodque, but his lemma has capto,
and his note rightly explains the construction and makes no mention 01
quodque. , 34 his text properly has Beiicit, his lemma lieffica't after
Avancius3 35 his text wrongly gives suspirans, the lemma suspiciea83
and so throughout the poem. This very singular circumstance I explain
in this way: he was living at Rome when his edition was printed and

seems to have sent the text and commentary separately3 for the book-
seller priuts at the end a long page of errors with this notice prefixed,
‘Hieronymus Platonicus Bononiensis bibliopola ad lectorem. contuli Pii
exemplar cum edito Lucretio: labeculasque pauculas notavi cet.' Pius’
edition was repriuted hy Ascensius in 1514 with not a few changes in
the text, some 01 them taken from the notes.

The next edition must be ever memorable in the history 01 Lucre·

tius, that published by Philip Giunta ‘anno salutis. 11111111. mense
martio’. Whether this means 1513 new style Ι cannot tell; but Ι
know that he dates a Gellius aud a Romualdi vita as published in
January 1513, ‘Leone pont. max. christianam R. P. moderante' and
‘Iconis X anno primo ’. Now Leo X only became pope iu March 01 1
that year 3 sothat here he must be speaking 01 1514; and in Florence at
all events this mode 01 dating seems to have been in common use. The
editor was Petrus Candidus who, great and important 'as the corrections
are which he has introduced, has yet used a copy 01 the first Aldine upon
which to make them, though he has never mentioned the name 01
Avancius. It seems to have been thepractice 01 those times to take at
least whatever was printed without acknowledgment: thus Giunta
regularly made booty 01 Aldus, Aldus 01 Giunta iu turn. What is said
in the present case is grounded on a close inspection 01 the two volumes.
Candidus, where he does not designedly leave him, follows Avaucius in
