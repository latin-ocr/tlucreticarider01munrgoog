NOTES I

ΟΝ THE FORMATION OF THE TEXT

Ir Lucretius had come down to us with a text as uninjured as that of
Virgil and a few other ancient writers, he could scarcely have been
reckoned ,among the most difficult Latin poeta Certainly he would
have been more easy to explain than Virgil for instance or Horaoe; for
he tells what he has 1ο tell simply and direotly, and among his poetical
merits is not included that of leaving his reader to guess which of many
possible meanings was the one he intended to convey. Fortune however ’
bas not dealt so kindly with him. Not that the great mass of his poem
is not in a scund and satisfactory state: in this respect he is better off
' than many others 3 but owing to the way in which it has been handed
down, his text has suffered in some portione irreparable loss. It is now
universally admitted that every existing copy of the poem has come from
one original, which has itself long disappeared.

Of existing manuscripts a fuller account will presently be given: let
it suffice for the moment to say that the two which Lachmann has
mainly followed and which evcry' future editor must follow, are now in
the library cf Leyden„ One is a folio written in the ninth century, the
other a quarto certainly not later than the tenth. Largo fragments of
one, if not of two others, of the same age as the quarto and very closely
resembling it are also still preserved, partly in Oopcnhagen, partly in
Vienna. These manuscripts and at least one more must have lain for
centuries in the monasteries of France or Germany, where they found at
different pericds several correctcrs, more or less competent. Itis tc be
presumed then that they had some readers, though few if any traces of.
them are to be met with in the volumincus literature of tha middle ages.

given me a reference to Honorius of Autun in the bibliotheca maxima
patrum xx p. 1001, who is there made 1ο quote 11 888 in this way, Ea
