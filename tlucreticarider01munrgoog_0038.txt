of his example. When 10 10 101100 known in England, the same result
will follow here. Thongh his Latin style is eminently clear lively and
appropriate, yet from his aim never to throw away words, as well as
from a mental peculiarity cf his, that 10 only cared to be understood by Ι
11000 whom he thought worthy to understand him, he is often obscure
and oracular on 0 first reading. Had his commentary been twice the
length it is, it would have been easier to master. But when once fully
apprehended his words are not soon forgotten. His love for merit of all
kinds incites in him a zeal to do justice 10 011 110 011 scholars who have
done anything 100110 001100 ; while his scorn and hatrcd 01 10001101
ignorance and ignoble sloth compel him to dennunce those whom 10 con·
victs of these offences. In one instance, that of Forbiger, this sternness
passes into ferocity: most 01 110 000000 1101 0010100 could hardly avoid in
the circumstances in which he was placed.

Hermann warns us, when we disagree with Lachmann, to think
twice lest we, not he, be in fault. His defects however must not 10
passed over. While the most essential part 01 110 work, the collation of
the two Leyden mss, has been performed with admirable skill and
industry, he has not been so happy in the use 01 secondary evidence, that
01 110 Ι101100 mss, and the older editions. Much he has taken on trust
on insufficient evidence, and much that he had before him 10 100 001
always accurately used. Some proofs of this have been given, more will
be seen below. But a still more serious defect must 10 told: he meant
his book to 10 0 critical revision of the text, and left to others the task
of explaining and illustrating the meaning. So far good: but as the
text 01 an author in the condition 01 1101 01 Lucretius cannot 10 always
rightly constructed without a sufficient knowledge of his system and its
literature, he has not unfrequently strangely blundered and grossly
corrupted the poet’s words: for examples of this see 1 599-63411 522
-529 lOlOfoll. v 513-516. His consummate knowledge 01 110 Latin
language as well as 01 110 manner 01 Lucretius in particular enables him
often to amend his author with great success. As he wishes too to pro-
duce, where itis possible, an intelligihle text, many 01 110 corrections he
must himself have looked upon as only provisional. Yet his greatest
admirere must concede that he has not Madvig's ‘curiosa felicitas' in
emendation. He has however achieved a work which will be a land-
mark for 00101000 00 long as the Latin language continues to be studied,
a work, perfidiae quod post nulla arpaet 00100.

J acob Bernays in 1852 edited a text 01 Lucretius for 110 Teubner
000100. There can be little doubt that carried away by the strength 01
110 admiration for Lachmann he has followed him too faithfully3 yet he
not unfrequently differs from him. Where he recalls the old reading he
isgenerally right, where 10 deserts him for a conjecture of his own, he
is often very successful. Had he prepared a more elaborate edition, as
