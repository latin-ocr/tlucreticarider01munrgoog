0101100001 his age could not himself furnish them; nay in one case he⁴
has given Lambinns' own words 00 those 01 Cicero. In his two bulky
volumes there is not one week's genuine work beyond what scissors and
peste could do: seldom has performance fallen so far short 01 profession
and opportunity. ’

’ ’111010 10 nothing to detain us between Havercamp and Wakefield
who in 1796 and 1797 gave his three volumes to the world, rivalling
the other's in magnitude. Yet the work, such 00 11 1010 his own, and
is not a mere slothful compilation from othere. Gilbert Wakefield pos-
sessed one quality which a critic can ill dispensa with, that of despising
any amount of authority which did not rest on some real foundation,
and refusing to admit that, because a reading had appeared in edition
after edition for centurias, it might hy that alone claim recognition. He
therefore set about a new revision which was to be based 011 manuscript
authority alone, but neither his knowledge nor his industry nor his
ability nor his taste sufficed 101 such a work. He professed to collate
five English mss, among them 0111 Cambridge one, and most of theold
editions, This task he executcd with incredihle carelessness, As he had
the full use of the Cambridge 1110, 0110 might have expected that his
collation 01 11 would be done with some 0010 ; but it is quite 1111111101-
worthy. From this as well aethe evidence 01 his own notes and the
nature 01 the 0000 Ι infer that his other 00110110110 010 1101 10010 10
be depended upon Had this labonr been faithfully performed, it would
still have been of little use, as he had no notion of the true relation
01 these late mse. 10 0110 another. He looked on each as an inde-
pendent authority and thought he could not do wrong, if the words he
put in his text were found in one or other 01 them. Thon he had to
take from Havercamp the readings 01 1110 Leyden 11100, 01111 therefore
could gain no true insight into their character. As he had no know-
ledge of the language or philosophy 01 his author, he undertook to
explain whatever words he put into his text in long turgid notes of
unmeaning verbiage. His work was got through with estrange precipi-
tancy: when engaged on the first part, he had never read the other parts
01 the poem3 when he came 10 1110111, he had forgotten what went before.
Morbidly vain and utterly unconscious of the immensureable distance
between Lambinus and himself, he assails the most brilliant and certain
emendations 01 the unrivalled scholar in a hideous jargon and with 0
vehemence of abuse that would be too great even 1011110 own errore.
Thus by some fatality or other, by its falling into the hands of 0 (1110111110
' Havercamp Wakefield instead of those of a Salmasius Gronovius Hein-
sius Bentley, the criticism of Lucretius remained for centuries where it
had been left hy Lambinus, nay even retrograded. And yet Wakefield
did display occasional flashes of native geniuS, and 0111 110100 will shew
that not a few certain corrections arc due to him 3 but 110111 the 11101 to
