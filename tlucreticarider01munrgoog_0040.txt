304, 0οἀ doubtless for the same reasons, because copied from the same
nra from which B was taken It usually goes by the name of the
Gottorpian fragment from the place where it once was. ·I have three
collatione of it, one published by Henrichsen in 1846, another in the
handwriting of Nic. Heinsius, another in that of Isaac Vossius. For·
merly it had a very high reputation: in truth it much resembles, hut is
more carelessly written than B, and is seldom of much use, except once
or twice to confirm A against B. Strangely enough there are in the
Vienna library fragments of a precisely similar ms containing large por-
110110 of the later books, viz. 11 642 to 111 621 inclusive, omitting how-
cver in the proper place 11 tot-806 exactly as 1Β (1000 3 then vl 743 to
the end3 then follow, precisely as 111 Β, the four omitted portione given
above, proving this to he copied from the ms. from which B was taken. ’
N aturally enough these Vienna fragments were assumed tc belong to one
and the same ms. as the Gottorpian3 but Dr, Ed. Goebel, from whom I
have borrowed this description of them, seems to prove in the Rhenish
Mus. n. s. x11 p. 449 foll. that the two portione now bound together are
of different sices and belonged to different msa However that may be,
the former part seems to be the same ms. as the Gottorpian, and the
other 11 not the same, is precisely the same in internal character3 and in
either case is of the same, that is of very little velue. Probably there-
fore a more accurate collation would hardly repay the labour.

All other 11100. known to exist were, as hasbeen already said, copied
mediately or immediately from Poggio's lost ms. which must have re-
sembled A almost as closely as the Gottorpian resembles B. The most
important are among the eight preserved at Florence in the. Laurentian

by Nicolb Niccoli himself, who had Poggio's ms. so long in his possession:
this we are told in the learned Mehus’ preface to his life of Traversarius
p. n. As he studied so many of Niccoli's manuscript letters, he must
have known his writing better than anybody else. There are many cor-
rections in a much later hand, but Niccoli himself seems on the whole to Ι
have copied Poggio's ms. faithfully‚ and not to have made many changes,
His ma therefore, as will be seen in notes l, is of great value in deciding
between A and B. It is unfortunate that Lachmann could make no use
01 it: I collated it with some care in the summer of 1851: the old
Verona and Venice editions have a text closely resembling Niccoli’s.

ingatext much more corrected than Niccoli's or even Ver. and Ven. It
is clearly written and in excellent preservation‚ and much resembles in
general character the manuscript in our public library which I had open
before me all the time Iwas composing notes 1, and which 10 as well
preserved and as distinctly written as the other. It excels the Gam-
bridge on the whole, though the latter has many good corrections not in
