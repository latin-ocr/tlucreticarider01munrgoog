given by Avancius, and in his learned preface he says with reference
11652 Nee tota pura cet. ‘totus prima brevi, quia quoti redditivus est’.
Crinitus l.l. xv 4 quotes 650 651 rightly, and adds ‘qua in re gramma
ticorum nobis authoritas patrocinatur, quando et centesimus et millesi-
mae probe dicitur: partem multesimuna inquit N onius nove positum est
a Lucretio pro minima, ne quis forte paulo incautius atque audacius
a veteribus decedat. quae a me vel ob eam rationem sunt adnotata,
quoniam Marullus Bizantius aetate nostra, vir alioqui diligens, paulo
improbius delere haec et alia pro ingenio subdere tentavit; quae ab eius
quoque sectatoribus recepta sunt pro verissimis '. Candidus gives these
two verses rightly and says in note at end ol J unt. ‘citatur Nonio locus':
he has got this clearly from Crinitus, who in the same chapter correctly
quotes and illustrates1640 Quomde grauis cet. which the Italian mas.
and editions had corrupted: this too Candidus took from him: for Marul-
lus appears to have read Quom grauior Graios inter as does Pius in his
notes, and Gryphius of Lyons. Again VI 332 Avancius rightly gives
per rara amsani, Candidus perversely after Marullus per operta: see his
note. But fifty instanceslike the last might be quoted, Candidus has
also missed some of the best of Marullus' conjectures: see for instance
notes l to 1 1013 where I have got from the margin of one of the Floren-
tino mss. perhaps the most brilliant example 11 his critical acumen.
Then again unless Ι greatly err Ι have shewn in my notes that Gifanius
in preparing his edition had before him a copy of the Venice ed. of 1495,
lent to him by the aealous scholar Sambucus, as he testifica both in his
preface 11 Sambucus and in his address to the reader. In the former he
says ‘exemplum Lucretii ad nos dedisti, non illum quidem calamo exa-

ratum, sed ita vetustum et idoneum, ut vicem optimi manuscripti fuerit, ,

siquidem in eo vidi omnium paene mendorum origines, quae magnam
partem a Michaele Marullo, cuius immutationes in eo adscriptae erant
omnes, primum parta, mox admiserunt Florentini cet’: in the address
he speaks of the ‘Sambuci liber quem ipsius Marulli manu adnotatum
magno pretio vir ille praestantissimus paravit’. Why then Lachmann
p. 6 should write ‘nequeenim facile Gifanio credere possum Marulli
ipsius manu annotatum fuisse illud exemplar impressum quod se ab
Iohanne Sambucc utendum accepisse scribit' Ι cannot comprehend.
Giianins was a dishonest plagiary, but at the same time a most astute
man. Why should he tell a gratuitous falsehocd which Sambucus would
at once detectt He was writing only two generations after Marullus'
death, and even if Sambucus gave his money for what was not the
handwriting of Marullus, it was at least 1 genuine copy of his notes.
But notes l furnish abundant proof of what I say: see for instance those
111806 11 16 v 44 and especially 111 994. It appears then that Avan-
eius got from Marullus much which the J untine does not record, and on
