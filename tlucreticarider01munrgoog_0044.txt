same number 01 11000 10 0 page: ours had 26 lines in a page, exeepting
only those which concluded a book. But remember there was a heading
or title at the beginning 01 each section3 and each of these headings oc
cupied a line. Lachmann brings many proofs of this being the number.
When this ms. was copied, it was clearly much torn and mutilated. It
was stated above that four portioris, omitted in their place by B, come
together at the end, and that these each formed a leaf of the archetype
which had fallen out of its proper place. Each of these alone or with its
headings consiste of 52 11000. Then turn to note 1 00 lv 299-347
(323-347 299-322) where this inversion is explained in the same way,
by the accident that is of aloose leaf being turned the wrong way: see
also note 1 10 1 1068-107 5 001 leae-1101, where the mutilation is

accounted for in the same manner. Thus wc obtain six certain land-
marks in different parts of the poem. The archetype therefore consisted
of 300 pagos, or admitting, as seems 10 be an undoubted fact, that a
whole 100110 lost between vr 839 and 840, 01 302 ; 01 which the first was
not written upon, 00 well as one for some reason or other somewhere
between 1 7 85, which ends one 01 the loose leaves at the end 01 Β, 001
1068 which, 00 shewn in note 1, begins a fresh leaf. Page 190 which
followed the end 01 1v was left blank. I may also note that pp. 137 001
191 contained 00 index of the headings of 1v and v respectively, while
the headings 01 v1 are crowded into the lower part of p. 249, the upper
part of which contained the last 13 lines 01 the text 01 v: see Lach. p.

398: although the different titles corne in their places in these books too, ⁴
as well as in the first three which have no such index prefixed. Having
made 100 myself a list of these pagos after the rules stated in various
places by Lachmann, I have found it of great use, 00 the ends of lines
throughout the poem towards the bottom of the several righthand pages
had been specially exposed to mutilation in the damaged archetype.
Verses also omitted in their proper places were apt in this as in other
mss. to be put afterwards at the bottom of pages. Besides the injurias
which it had received from accident or ill usage, our archetype must

have been carelessly enough written, though A and B prove that it re·
tained many valuable vestiges of great antiquity, especially in the spell-
ing of words, and though there may have been few stages between it
and the age 01 the author. Tharais 000 point, the nature 01 the hiatus

after 1v 126, 00 10 which it is not easy to accept Lachmann's theory.
That there is a hiatus there, is indisputable and the special questions
connected with itare fully discussed in note 1 10 that passage. As the
accidental loss 010 whole leaf would not suit his system 01 pages, he
boldly declares that twenty-five verses and one heading have perished,
that is one single page 01 our archetype. Now it is easy enough, 00 we
have seen, to explain the accidental loss of a leaf, by which every subse-
quent copy must necessarily want the contents 01 that leaf: it is easy
