half 01 the twelfth century had taken the line from the poem itself;
or had borrowed it from Priscian inst. 1v 27 who cites it with nasci
instead 01 gigni, the editor of the bibliotheca having thought fit taeitly tc
substitute pipat from Lucretius. The latter is proved to be the fact by
Mr Julius Jessen in the philologus, vol 30 pp. 236-238: he quotes
what follows from Barthius' very learned note 011 Stat. silv. 11 7 76;
‘nec vero cadentibus ant collapsis iam rebus Romanis auctoritatem suam
amisit Lueretius noster, ut videre potes apud Magnentium Rhabanum
praefatione Laudum Daedalarum Crucis, Gulielmum Hirsaugiensem in
Institutionibus Philosophicis et Astrologicis‚ Honoriunr Augustodunen-
0001 111 Historia Mundi, Ven. Bedanr Libro de Metris'. Referring to 1110
’ only printed edition of this work 01 William of Hirschau, who lived
from 1026 to 1091, he shews that Honorius copied from him the passage
in question, and that William cites it thus: ‘Ex insensili credas sensile
nasei’, getting it clearly then from Priscian. Hrabanus Maurus and
Beda seem justas little to have known Lueretius at first hand. [Hermes
vol. 8 p. 332, it is said that in Brit. Mus, ms. 377 (l3th century) of
Daniel de Merlai’s Philosophia, in p. 90 a, Lucretius is quoted]

In Italy he was even more completely unknown. A catalogue which
Ι Muratori antiq. 111 p. 820 assigns to the tenth century, proves that the
famous library of Bobbio contained at that time 11111001 Lucretii 1 3 bnt
before the fifteenth no Italian poet or writer shews any knowledge 01 ·
him whatever. In the year 1414 the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini went
as apostolic secretary to the 0001101101 Constante and remained on this
side the Alps in different countries‚ Switzerland Germany France and
England, until 1420, with one short interval passed in Milan and
Mantua. During these years he procured from 101100011101100101100111011)1
most important Latin works hitherto totally unknown in Italy: see
Mehus' preface to his life of Ambrosius Traversarius p. xxxiii foll.
Among these was 0 manuscript 01 Lucretius, obtained apparently from
some German monastery either by him 01 his companion Bartholomew
01 Montepulcian0, about 1417 as his letters seem to indicate, and trans·

This manuscript, which Poggio wrongly supposed to be only a part 01 the
poem, has 110011 disappeared, but was 1110 parent 01 every copy written
during the 15th century, that is to say of every one now extant with the
exception 01 those specified above: it must have very closely resembled
the Leyden folio. ‘Et te, Lucreti, longo post tempore tandem Civibus
et patriae reddit habere suae’ says Landinus in 1110 poem in praise 01
Poggio. Niccoli having such a treasure in his hands was in no hurry to
part with it. We find Poggio writing 10 him in December 1429 1010-
mind him that he had kept his Lucretius twelve years. A few days
later it is ‘you have had Lucretius now for fourteen years 3 I want to read
