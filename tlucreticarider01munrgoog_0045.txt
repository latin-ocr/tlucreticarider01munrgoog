enough to conceive any one ms, A orB or Poggio’s passing over by
mistake one whole page. But it is in the highest degree unlikely that
different copies, A B and Poggio's„neither of which as Lachmann admits
was copied from the other, should all pass over a single page of their ori-
ginal; or that this single page should be wholly illegible, while that
which preceded and the reverse page of the same leaf should be entirely
uniny'ured. It seems to me therefore much more natural to assume that
our archetype or one of its predecessors accidentally omitted an uncertain
number of verses3 οι· rather theta whole leaf of the archetype had been
. lost, as after v1 839. Lachmann's system of pagination would then be
set right in this way: only books lv and v have an iudea cupitum pre·
fixed filling one page3 for that of VI as I have said is crammed into the
lower part of the last page of v: before this index in v Lachmann has
shewn that the archetype had one blank page. Assume now that one
page was similarly left blank before the index of 1v and all will be right:
the peges of the archetype would then be raised to 304. The iudex cupi-
tum prefixed to v1 I accidentally omitted to notice in former editions, as
it had no bearing on the question of peges. Thc assumption here made
which is commended by Mr Polle, but blamed by Mr Susemihl in philo
log. xx1x p. 427 foll, I still think probable. The latter asks what con-
ceivable reason there could have been for the two blank pages before v,
except to begin the new book with a new leaf, as was done with all the
rest. Why, 1 which had no index prefixed began on the second page of
a leaf; so did 111, which had no such index, so did VI whose index is
crowded together in the manner spoken of Other mss. such as the me-
dicean of Virgil, seem to have no preference for beginning a book on a
new leaf. Why the two peges were left for the index between 1v and v
I do not know, any more than why a page was left vacant somewhere be-
tween1785and 1068: it had something to do perhaps with calculatione
about the parchment required. I was going to say more, but forbear to
enlarge on so fruitless a topic.

But we are able to advance even beyond the archetype: in many
parts of the poem there are manifest undoubted interpolations‚ which
must have been inserted by some reader who wished at one time to con-
firm what is said, at another to convict it of inconsistency and the like.
Generally‚ not always, these passages are repetitions of genuine passages 3
sometimes they consist of several, sometimes of a single verse: 144-
49 and 111 806-818 are good and incontrovertible examples. But
enough is said of these throughout our notes. Lachmann however still
unsatisfied has not paused even here, but has gone up to the very times
cf the poet. No careful reader will refuse to admit tliat he has proved
not a few passages, some of them among the finest in the poem, to have
been subsequent additions made by the author, which he did not live to
embody properly with τ’ *f his work. Lachmann has gone too far,
